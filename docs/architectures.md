## Introduction



## Generic Architectures for Ontology Applications (ERIC P)
The diagram below shows a generic OWL application architecture. Applications like those listed in the sections above can query a knowledge graph. Preexisting services or systems A and B can interoperate via a shared ontology that contains mappings between classes and properties.

The diagram below shows a generic OWL backend architecture. Structured and unstructured text data can be ingested into the knowledge graph to support queries of heterogeneous sources.
